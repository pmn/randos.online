#  randos.online

a collection of randos on the internet

To add your profile to the list, just include this markdown in your profile's README.md: 

`[![alt text goes here](https://randos.online/u/yourusername)](https://randos.online/u/yourusername/next)`

(Make sure to replace `yourusername` with your GitHub username in both spots).

When visitors click your badge, they'll be directed to another random GitHub user who also has the badge (and other profile clicks will lead to yours). 

Here's mine!
